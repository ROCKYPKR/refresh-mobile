# fresh_air

An application for FreshAir, the University of Edinburgh's student-run radio station.

Note: This application will not work for the moment without cloning the audio_stream_player (https://github.com/adrianczuczka/audio_stream_player) plugin too, because this project has a local dependency to it. This will be fixed once audio_stream_player is uploaded to Pub.
